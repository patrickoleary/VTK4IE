	* Immersive Visualization has been demonstrated to have value

		    - Anecdotes: Borher/Kreylos/Kinsland
	* VTK: proven and continually improving, and has large community for
		developing scienctific visualizations
	* Together, even better

	* Also, the reach of VR is expanding in Leaps
		    - but mostly for games

	* Motivation: take advantage of a proven visualization system to
		create beneficial immersive visualizaiton tools using
		existing VR integration libraries. (Vrui, FreeVR, and now
		OpenVR).

		    - many new adopters of VR, who could benefit from a

		    - OpenGL context sharing

\pwo{Bill, the following should end the introduction and spells out our contributions.}

Our two approaches for the amalgamation of VTK and an immersive environment through a VR Toolkit, makes several contributions to immersive scientific visualization.

\textbf{OpenGL context sharing}. Our vtkRenderingExternal VTK module provides a complete integration including lights, interaction, picking and access to the entire VTK pipeline. This, in turn, enables simple utilization for application developers with any OpenGL-based VR Toolkit.

\textbf{VR Toolkit embedding}. The OpenVR VTK module supports several immersive environments now without the issues faced by previous work, and is a complete template for embedding other VR Toolkits within VTK in the future.

\textbf{Enhanced performance}. This effort includes VTK enhancements that significantly impact immersive environment application development. These enhancements include:

\begin{compactitem}
\item The new default OpenGL 3.2+ pipeline;
\item dual depth peeling for transparency; and 
\item symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) tools and algorithms.
\end{compactitem}

Finally, we have exposed the framework of our image-based approach to the scientist through an advanced selection interface that allows them to make sophisticated (time, storage, analysis, ...) decisions for the production of \textit{in situ} visualization and analysis output.

In the sections that follow, we illustrate how our amalgamation of VTK and VR Toolkits supports our goals for enhancing scientific visualization in immersive environments.
