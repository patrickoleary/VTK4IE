\abstract{Modern scientific, engineering and medical computational simulations and/or experimental and observational data sensing/measuring devices produce enormous amounts of data. While statistical analysis provides insight into this data, it is scientific visualization that is tactically important for scientific discovery, product design and data analysis. Implementing scientific visualization algorithms from scratch can be a time consuming and redundant process in immersive application development. The open source Visualization Toolkit (VTK) community delivers state-of-the-art software to speedup application development. But, over the past two (almost three) decades, integrating VTK with a virtual reality environment has been attempted to varying degrees of success. In this paper, we demonstrate two new approaches to simplify this amalgamation pushed into VTK. In addition, we cover several enhancements to VTK that provide near real-time updates and efficient interaction. Finally, we demonstrate the combination of VTK with both Vrui and OpenVR immersive environments in example applications.
